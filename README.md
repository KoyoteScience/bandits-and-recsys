Personalization and recommender systems present unique challenges that can be addressed with intelligent bandit design. These algorithms require less feature-engineering, and use embeddings to represents users, queries, and items, making them the go-to for products with a history of interactions to build upon. When working with new users or when substantial historical data has not been recorded, bandits can help collect this data efficiently. Moreover, while recommender systems have evolved to enormously complex extremes to accommodate signals as quickly as possible, bandits paired with recommender systems can capture user intent in the moment, which is a tremendous improvement. This document outlines the recommender system problem, how bandits have been used to address issues in the past, and how we would do it differently.
